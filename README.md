# Coding practice

This repo contains a bunch of coding exercises from a variety of different resources, including...

* Cracking the coding interview: Exercises are split up by chapter (i.e. the folders named *1*, *2*, etc...).
* [Princeton algorithms website](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/): Exercises are in the *princeton_algos* folder.
* Miscellaneous exercises around the web: Exercises are in *algos* folder.
* General purpose data structures (in the *utils* folder).

### Tests

Most of the *princeton* and *random algos* stuff are just tested with `console.log`s in their respective files.  However, _most_ of the CTCI problems have decent test coverage in the *spec* folder... again organized by chapter.
